<h1  >My backstory</h1>
<p >I started art at 5th grade so I'm still 4 years in art experience.Before 5th grade I really did not know a thing much about art and academics, I got into art because I really wanted to create my own character<br>
Overtime being an artist has really change my perspective. I started to become more open to new things even if it scares me, Sometimes making art is makes me mad because it dosen't <br> come out
the way I wanted it to but at the end of the day it satisfy me, I love art because I can express the way I see the world .</p>
